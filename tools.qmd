## Whole game

Here is a qmd file, go to the folder in your terminal, run quarto render

## RStudio

## JupyterLab

- ipynb vs. qmd: from now on Quarto document usually means qmd but things translate to ipynb -- orient for qmd-specific language throughout book and how that translates to ipynb
   		* and maybe another chapter somewhere specifically about this if this gets too long

## VSCode

## Choosing a tool

- whatever you already use
- one possible criterion: visual editor with various tools and mention how it will be called out
