title: Presentations

Quarto supports a variety of formats for creating presentations, including:

-   `revealjs` (HTML)

-   `pptx` (MS Office)

-   `beamer` (LaTeX/PDF)

There are pros and cons to each of these formats.
The most capable format by far is `revealjs` so is highly recommended unless you have specific requirements for Office or LaTeX output.
Note that `revealjs` presentations can be presented as HTML slides or can be printed to PDF for easier distribution.

We start this chapter by describing the basic syntax for presentations that applies to all formats.
In later sections we will also touch on format-specific features.

## Sections and slides

Level 1 headings identify sections and Level 2 headings identify slides.
These headings also create breaks between slides.
For breaks between slides without titles, use dashes `---`.

``` markdown
---
title: "Slide deck"
author: "John Doe"
format: revealjs
---

# Section 1 title

## Slide 1 title

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

## Slide 2 title

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

---

Slide without title:

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
```

::: callout-note
We will continue to use level 1 headings for section brakes and level 2 headings for slide breaks.
However it's possible to customize this using the `slide-level` option, e.g., `slide-level: 1` to use level 1 headings for slide breaks.
See the Pandoc documentation on [structuring the slide show](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#structuring-the-slide-show) (<https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#structuring-the-slide-show>) for additional details.
