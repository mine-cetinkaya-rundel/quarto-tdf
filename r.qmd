# Quarto and R {#sec-r}

```{r}
1 + 1
```

assume knitr

- https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#data-frames -- Is this relevant to other languages or R specific at all? 

- figuring out R installation Quarto is seeing: https://quarto.org/docs/troubleshooting/#knitr

- https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html - use in other chapters too, and https://quarto.org/docs/computations/render-scripts.html

- apply at document level: https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html
    - apply at cell level https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html, and only some of them work at document level (and not all of these work for other engines)

end with other combinations of engines and why you might use them -- 2 languages in the same document without embedding and passing objects between languages
